# 🎭 ERROR 415 – Unsupported Media Type

Welcome to the chaos.

This repo is where I dump all the cool, weird, broken, and maybe brilliant visual experiments that didn’t quite fit anywhere else.

## 🧩 What's Inside?

- 🔥 Fiery backgrounds and moody gradients  
- 👁️ Monster edits and mysterious silhouettes  
- 🎨 Color tests that looked better at 3AM  
- 📸 Screenshots of things that almost worked  
- 📱 Layouts that cried on mobile

## ⚒️ Why?

Because sometimes you just gotta make stuff — not for polish, not for perfection, just to see what happens.

## 📵 Heads-Up

This stuff looks... different on phones. Some of it is better. Some of it is an abomination. That’s part of the fun.
